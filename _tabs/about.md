## About
Hey, I’m Mohammad Saalim.

I mostly work around AOSP and the parts of Android that sit close to hardware. My day-to-day work usually lives somewhere between the Linux kernel, device bring-up, HALs, and framework/system services, typically the “why is the device not booting / not working / not fast enough” side of Android.

I enjoy debugging weird, layered issues that happen at the kernel - HAL - frameworks — the kind where the logs don’t immediately make sense and the fix ends up using brain cells :).

This blog is where I write down what I learn while building, breaking, fixing, and upgrading Android systems - hopefully it helps someone else too.

## What I work on
- Android Platform: AOSP frameworks, system services, apps, permissions
- Hardware Integration: IMU, touchscreens, sensors (Driver → HAL → Framework)
- Kernel & BSP: Device tree, driver development, rebasing, bring-up debugging
- IPC & Services: AIDL design, native services, Binder debugging
- Security: SELinux, permissions, platform signing, TPM, U-Boot
- Performance: Perfetto, systrace, simpleperf — jank, battery, startup optimization stuff
- Upgrades & LTS: Android version upgrades (9–16), long-term device maintenance
