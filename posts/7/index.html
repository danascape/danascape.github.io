This might be a biased take, but in my experience, the first step isn’t to understand the entire system, it’s just to get used to the build system and boot it somehow. Whether it be a custom smartphone, emulator, or any other embedded hardware.\nStart by learning how to:\nDownload the source Build an image Flash it to a real device or emulator Once you’ve successfully compiled and flashed your first build, the next steps, tweaking features, debugging logs, upstreaming changes, or even building your own product will come in eventually.\nAOSP Can Be Anything Before I go deeper, I’ve decided not to throw everything into a single blog post. Instead, I’ll break this into a short series where I’ll cover:\nWhat you can do with AOSP (trust me, it’s a lot more than you can imagine) How to get started (step-by-step) Prerequisites (tools, machines, repositories) What is AOSP exactly? How long it takes to build, boot, and development Whether you’re an applications developer, a systems engineer, or just curious about the OS behind billions of devices, AOSP has something for you.\nFor Today If you’re new and wondering where to begin, here’s my advice:\nDon’t aim to understand everything at once. Just try to build and boot a device first. Everything else — debugging, customization, mainlining, and contributing — will follow. Stay tuned for Part 2, where we’ll start with “What is AOSP, really?” and why it’s more than just a pile of code.\n","wordCount":"349","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-20T00:00:00+05:30","dateModified":"2025-07-20T00:00:00+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"squadri"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://danascape.github.io/posts/7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Saalim Quadri","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://danascape.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://danascape.github.io/ accesskey=h title="squadri (Alt + H)"><img src=https://danascape.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>squadri</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
