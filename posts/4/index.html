The Linux Kernel is an open-source project that continuously evolves through the collective effort of thousands of developers worldwide.\nLKMP is one of the programmes run by the Linux Foundation where we get to learn about subsytems inside Linux Kernel and how to contribute to them. Under the mentorship, we got hands-on experience in debugging and resolving issues within the kernel. The program follows a structured approach to ensure participants gain valuable hands-on experience and become proficient in kernel development.\nAbout Device Tree Bindings The Device Trees were originally created by Open Firmware as part of the communication method for passing data from Open Firmware to a client program. An operating system used the Device tree to discover the topology of the hardware at runtime, and thereby support a majority of available hardware without hard coded information.\nThe Device Tree is simply a data structure that describes the hardware. It provides a language for decoupling the hardware configuration from the board and device driver support in the Linux Kernel. Using it allows board and device support to become data driven; to make setup decisions based on data passed into the kernel instead of on per-machine hard coded selections.\nApplying for LFX mentorship I applied through the LFX mentorship portal where for a particular section you can apply to a maximum of three projects where first you have to create your profile, tell a bit about your background and then apply to the projects you want.\nI decided to apply for Linux Kernel Mentorship Programme Spring 2023. Here I had to go through a list of different tasks which tests your current knowledge about Linux Kernel, Command-line tools, etc. After completing those tasks and submitting my resume, I got my selection email for being selected as a mentee for Linux Kernel Mentorship Program My 12 Weeks Mentorship Journey My mentorship period was from 1st March 2023 to 31st May 2023. During this period I had to work with Linux Kernel where I had to pick among different subsystems and fix bugs on them.\nMy mentor, Shuah Khan introduced us with a list of debugging techniques and ways to resolve them. This included using various command-line tools like GDB, event tracing, dynamic analysis of programs, and also the in-famous Google’s Syzkaller. With the help of my mentor, I learnt about various subsystems in the linux kernel, from where I chose to contribute to the conversion of Device Tree Bindings to YAML format.\nEvery week, I used to have a meeting with my mentors other than having discussions on the communication channel with other mentees where we discussed about our subsystems and policies.\nAnd finally, I ended up submitting 13 patches as part of the mentorship program.\nIn the End Apart from the bug fixing, I also learned few other interesting things about the Linux kernel and its developer community, like how we test various changes in the kernel and why we strictly use plain text emails.\nMy mentorship program experience has been fantastic, and I recommend it to everyone interested in pursuing Linux Kernel development and looking for mentorsing.\nI am heartily thankful to my mentor Greg KH, Shuah Khan and The Linux Foundatioon, for providing me with this opportunity and a great learning experience.\nPatches can be found on https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/?q=danascape\nLet me know your experience with reading this blog at my email.\n","wordCount":"693","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-27T00:00:00+05:30","dateModified":"2023-07-27T00:00:00+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"squadri"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://danascape.github.io/posts/4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Saalim Quadri","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://danascape.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://danascape.github.io/ accesskey=h title="squadri (Alt + H)"><img src=https://danascape.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>squadri</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
