For this week, we got the application working in qemu environment, which required us to create ldconfig to ros2 libraries which exists in a separate path (/opt/ros/humble/lib), so the application is running alright with no issues so far, and even communicates with ros2.
This was tested on both trout, and master branch with flutter workspace_automation env (v2.0 branch).

mkdir /etc/ld.so.conf.d
echo '/opt/ros/humble/lib' | tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ros2.conf
ldconfig

The above were the steps I had to do, so for the same I pushed a patch on [gerrit][patchset]. It's tested and works!

Additionally to this, I was able to get the flutter-app recipe working and the app installed on AGL.
The app runs but I am not able to get ros2 communication, maybe we need to debug that part. I will attach some screenshots for the same.

As for ROS2, I was planning to talk to Rob regarding some references I can find which can help me in running ROS and a camera feed with object detection.

So mostly, my plan for this week is to fix the flutter application and make the code readable, since everything currently is in a single file, so I will try to separate out the utilities and Theming parts. This is the patch for application [https://gerrit.automotivelinux.org/gerrit/c/AGL/meta-agl-devel/+/31175][patchset2] and I would like to keep it on the gerrit as of now, until some base application part is complete where the code is readable for others.

## Get Involved
Stay tuned for the detailed technical deep-dives in the upcoming blog posts. I am planning to include examples, code, etc, such that anyone can follow along with it.
