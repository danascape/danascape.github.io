By this point, I had both AGL and ROS building successfully on their own.  
That meant there *shouldn't* be any major issues when compiling them together—so it was finally time to start integrating them.

During my face-to-face call with my mentors, I asked how I should approach the integration.

My first step was to clone the `meta-ros` **scarthgap** branch, initialize the AGL environment, and try compiling a ROS-specific package.


* I cloned the `meta-ros` layer into `external/meta-ros` inside the AGL home directory:
```bash
git clone -b scarthgap https://github.com/ros/meta-ros external/meta-ros
```

* Checking the AGL directory structure:
```bash
➜  agl tree -L 1
.
├── bsp
├── external
├── meta-agl
├── meta-agl-demo
├── meta-agl-devel
├── qemux86-64
├── raspberrypi4
└── raspberrypi5
```

* And inside the `external` folder:
```bash
➜  agl tree -L 1 external
external
├── meta-clang
├── meta-codechecker
├── meta-flutter
├── meta-openembedded
├── meta-python-ai
├── meta-qt6
├── meta-ros
├── meta-security
├── meta-selinux
├── meta-spdxscanner
├── meta-tensorflow
├── meta-virtualization
├── poky
└── workspace-automation
```

* I then initialized the AGL environment and built `ros-core`:
```bash
source meta-agl/scripts/aglsetup.sh -f -m raspberrypi4 -b raspberrypi4 agl-flutter agl-devel agl-demo
bitbake ros-core
```

It took a while.
I even had to do a clean build since I hadn’t set up an sstate cache or a local downloads server—meaning everything had to be fetched and built from scratch.
Eventually, the build completed successfully.


It took some time, I did a clean build again, at this point I did not setup sstate cache and downloads server to my local, so It downloaded everything again and compiled, eventually I succeeded in this, and now just had to figure out the template
