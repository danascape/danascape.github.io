For this week, I pushed the patchsets in-sync with the current application, it compiles alright, and even the camera stream is working!!!!. The python library issue that I discussed is still present, so the face and person detection is not working, affected python libraries are

fer, dlib, ultralytics.

dlib and ultralytics seem to be bundled with meta-python-ai but they did not compile on my end. As for fer we do need to write a recipe for it.
