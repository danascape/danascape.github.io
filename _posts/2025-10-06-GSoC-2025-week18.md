For this week, I got the app UX changes, as suggested, and additionally I was able to get the app running on pi500, not the SDK yet, but the latest app, the camera stream requires a few python packages, which I need to ask about for installation.

## Get Involved
Stay tuned for the detailed technical deep-dives in the upcoming blog posts. I am planning to include examples, code, etc, such that anyone can follow along with it.
