For last week, we were able to reach a final UX on the flutter application, and I am working on implementation for model switching, there are a lot of python dependencies being used, so I am re-working on cutting them up, like face-detection libraries usually use cuda, but we won't have GPU on pi500, so I am working on trimming out those things.

Additionally, the application works on pi500, I was able to get the camera stream going but no detection is working as of now, I am able to debug it and will spend time this week to continue.

## Get Involved
Stay tuned for the detailed technical deep-dives in the upcoming blog posts. I am planning to include examples, code, etc, such that anyone can follow along with it.
