For this week, I was able to refactor the app code and test it on the hardware itself, as we discussed at the Friday meeting regarding potential fixes for users.
The closure was:
Using ldconfig, along with logging into agl-driver user (su - agl-driver), and then communication with the application, which worked successfully.

The refactored application code is complete, to make the code more readable ([https://github.com/danascape/ros-flutter][source]).

Currently, I am trying to fix the app for camera stream, as soon as it works, I will be able to show it to you tonight if not then wednesday.

## Get Involved
Stay tuned for the detailed technical deep-dives in the upcoming blog posts. I am planning to include examples, code, etc, such that anyone can follow along with it.
