For this week, I have almost completed the application, and have tested it on native Linux, and am working on integrating it in yocto builds and recipes, I have camera stream working on pi but no the model yet.

For this week, I am aiming to get the app to run fully on pi, and test out all the use cases.

## Get Involved
Stay tuned for the detailed technical deep-dives in the upcoming blog posts. I am planning to include examples, code, etc, such that anyone can follow along with it.
