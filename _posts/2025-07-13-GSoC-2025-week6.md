During this week, I had a productive call with my mentors, where we delved into the correct way of handling ROS package dependencies in Yocto builds. I gained a better understanding of the difference between two key directives: `IMAGE_FEATURE` and `IMAGE_INSTALL`. This distinction was crucial in finalizing my patchset and ensuring that the ROS packages are integrated correctly.

I spent time exploring and understanding the differences between `IMAGE_FEATURE` and `IMAGE_INSTALL` in Yocto. This research ultimately helped me refine my final patch. For context, `IMAGE_INSTALL` is used to add packages directly to the target image, while `IMAGE_FEATURE` is used to enable certain image features that may include adding groups of packages or enabling particular functionalities. Knowing when to use each of these is important to properly manage dependencies and optimize the Yocto image.


### Updated `agl-ros2.inc` Configuration

Here is the modification I made to the `agl-ros2.inc` file in `meta-agl-ros2/conf/include/agl-ros2.inc`:

```bash
# Add minimal core ROS
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " \
    ros-core \
"
```

By appending ros-core to IMAGE_INSTALL, I ensured that the minimal set of ROS packages required for the system to function was included in the image. This change was important because it ensures that the system can run core ROS functionalities, which are vital for robotics and autonomous driving applications.

Stay tuned for the detailed technical deep-dives in the upcoming blog posts. I am planning to include examples, code, etc, such that anyone can follow along with it.
