For this week, Me and Rob spent time on flutter workspace_automation, but there had been no updates on it so far, specifically run-agl-ivi-demo-flutter-qemu did not show up for us both. I was able to source the workspace_automation env to run the app on native linux but not the qemu environment. 
If I have qemu running on a window, it shows in flutter devices, but while trying flutter run -d desktop-homescreen, it throws me Failed to connect to the Wayland display. No such file or directory.

I pushed a patch for the bitbake recipe of the app, but it needs LD_LIBRARY path set to ros2 libraries to compile. (export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/ros/humble/opt/rviz_ogre_vendor/lib:/opt/ros/humble/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:/opt/ros/humble/lib)
Link: [https://gerrit.automotivelinux.org/gerrit/c/AGL/meta-agl-devel/+/31175][patchset]

Additionally to this, we were able to resolve the issue and a demo flutter app is running on qemu.

## Get Involved
Stay tuned for the detailed technical deep-dives in the upcoming blog posts. I am planning to include examples, code, etc, such that anyone can follow along with it.
