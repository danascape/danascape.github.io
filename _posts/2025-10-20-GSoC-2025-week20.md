Last week, I was able to implement model detection for the driver seat as well as the person seat, where each model works in different aspects, for driver seat, it is able to detect mood, fatigue, and for the front camera it is able to detect object distance and give warnings in both scenarios.

I am compiling for pi500 to see how it goes on that end now, and can proceed finally to the full testing phase of the project.

Additionally to this, I faced the critical bug scenario where the camera stream got stuck after 1-2 minutes, I have fixed that as well

## Get Involved
Stay tuned for the detailed technical deep-dives in the upcoming blog posts. I am planning to include examples, code, etc, such that anyone can follow along with it.
