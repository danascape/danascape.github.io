      <description>What is LFX mentorship? “The Linux Foundation Mentorship Program is designed to help developers — many of whom are first-time open source contributors — with necessary skills and resources to learn, experiment, and contribute effectively to open source communities. By participating in a mentorship program, mentees have the opportunity to learn from experienced open source contributors as a segue to get internship and job opportunities upon graduation.” Please have a look at the Mentorship guide to learn how to participate in LFX Mentorship programs: lfx.</description>
